# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Course-Project
This repository is created for the project of the course `Getting-and-Cleaning-Data'.

The purpose is to create a R script named `run_analysis.R' that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Steps to work on this course project

To generate the required data set, first download the original data files and put them into your own folder, together with the R script file. Set the working directory of R to be the folder you put these files.

Run the script which will automatically generate a txt file named `tiny_data.txt' in the same folder.
